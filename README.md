Very crude and simple wget gui

#why another wget front end when there is wgetgui
This is currently the least functional front end
for this application, but it does exactly I need it
to do.  I may expand it more in the future.  Also if
you stumble across it and don't like it, feel free
to edit it yourself and send me a pull request.
